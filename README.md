### Description:
Shadow is a web application designed to be your personal companion on the profound journey of shadow work. It provides the tools and perspectives needed to explore your inner world, understand your hidden nature, and integrate your shadow self to achieve true authenticity.

### Core Philosophy
This app uniquely merges two powerful perspectives on the human shadow:

 **_Carl Jung's Psychological Framework:_**
     For deep, introspective healing and self-acceptance.

 **_Robert Greene's Pragmatic Insights:_** 
    From "The Laws of Human Nature," for understanding how the shadow manifests in real-world social dynamics.

By combining these views, Shadow offers a holistic approach to personal growthâ€”helping you not only understand yourself but also navigate your interactions with others more effectively.

### Key Features
